Lab 1.1: Exploring iControl
===========================

The iControl REST API available via TMOS can be directly accessed and endpoints explored.

#. Open Google Chrome and navigate to the following bookmarks: BIG-IP A GUI and BIG-IP API ToC.  Accept any SSL warnings/errors that appear and ensure that you can access both login prompts.
#. Click on the **BIG-IP API ToC** bookmark to access the API Table of Contents for BIG-IP A.  The ``/mgmt/toc`` path in the URL is available on all TMOS versions 11.6 or newer.
#. Authenticate using the default **admin/admin** credentials.
#. After successfully authenticating, you will be presented with a top-level list of REST resources available on the BIG-IP.  At the top of the page is a search box that can be used to search for specific REST resources.
